To run the program do the following steps:
1. Clone the code into your Arduino IDE
2. Set up a circuit similar to the following (TinkerCad link: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/c6EpJxxcw0q-led-button):

3. Upload the code to your Arduino and wait for the built-in LED to turn on. Once it is on, press the button as many times as you want in the 5 seconds the built-in LED is on.
4. The LED on the breadboard should blink the same number of times you pressed the button during the time the builtin LED was on.
